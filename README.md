# DotPunch
This is a joint project between me and my friend Jack to create a frame of fighting pads that can light up and sense 
impact as an aid to training. Full implementation of the project will be detailed on the repo wiki.

Currently the project is in design/poc phase

## Pi Setup
After imaging and booting for the first time log in with default pi / raspberry and run:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3
$ sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/mrhockeymonkey/DotPunch.git
```
